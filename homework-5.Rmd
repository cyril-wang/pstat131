## Elastic Net Tuning

For this assignment, we will be working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

Read in the file and familiarize yourself with the variables using `pokemon_codebook.txt`.

```{r}
# set up stuff
set.seed(123)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(dplyr)
library(discrim)
library(glmnet)
pokemon <- read.csv('data/pokemon.csv')
head(pokemon)
```

### Exercise 1

Install and load the `janitor` package. Use its `clean_names()` function on the Pokémon data, and save the results to work with for the rest of the assignment. What happened to the data? Why do you think `clean_names()` is useful?

```{r}
# install.packages('janitor')
library(janitor)
pokemon_clean <- pokemon %>% clean_names()
head(pokemon_clean)
```
Looking at the data, it seems that the only change that was made is that the variable names were changed into a consistent format, with all variables turning into lower-case and variables with multiple words are now separated by an underscore. I think this is useful as it deals with the issue of weird or problematic variable names, changing them into a cleaner format, and it is just generally easier and more understandable for the user when handling variables due to the consistent format. 

### Exercise 2

Using the entire data set, create a bar chart of the outcome variable, `type_1`.

How many classes of the outcome are there? Are there any Pokémon types with very few Pokémon? If so, which ones?

For this assignment, we'll handle the rarer classes by simply filtering them out. Filter the entire data set to contain only Pokémon whose `type_1` is Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, or Psychic.

After filtering, convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors.

```{r}
pokemon_clean %>% ggplot(aes(x = type_1)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```

There are 18 classes/types. The Flying type seems to have relatively very few Pokemon. 

```{r}
types <- c("Bug", "Fire", "Grass", "Normal", "Water", "Psychic")
pokemon_filter <- pokemon_clean %>% filter(type_1 %in% types)
pokemon_filter$type_1 <-factor(pokemon_filter$type_1)
pokemon_filter$legendary <-factor(pokemon_filter$legendary)
pokemon_filter$generation <-factor(pokemon_filter$generation) # not in directions, but needed for step_dummy later
head(pokemon_filter)
```

### Exercise 3

Perform an initial split of the data. Stratify by the outcome variable. You can choose a proportion to use. Verify that your training and test sets have the desired number of observations.

Next, use *v*-fold cross-validation on the training set. Use 5 folds. Stratify the folds by `type_1` as well. *Hint: Look for a `strata` argument.* Why might stratifying the folds be useful?

```{r}
# initial split
pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon_filter, prop = 0.7,  strata = "type_1")
pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)
# check number of observations
dim(pokemon_train)
dim(pokemon_test)

# v-fold cross-validation
pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v = 5, strata = "type_1")

```

Stratifying the folds might be useful in making sure that each fold has similar/equivalent proportions as the original data.

### Exercise 4

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`.

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;

- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
# recipe
pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def, data= pokemon_train) %>%
                    step_dummy(legendary) %>%
                    step_dummy(generation) %>%
                    step_normalize(all_predictors())

pokemon_recipe
```

### Exercise 5

We'll be fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg` with the `glmnet` engine).

Set up this model and workflow. Create a regular grid for `penalty` and `mixture` with 10 levels each; `mixture` should range from 0 to 1. For this assignment, we'll let `penalty` range from -5 to 5 (it's log-scaled).

How many total models will you be fitting when you fit these models to your folded data?

```{r}
# set up model
elastic_spec <- multinom_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %>%
                set_mode("classification") %>%
                set_engine("glmnet")
# set up workflow
elastic_workflow <- workflow() %>% 
                add_recipe(pokemon_recipe) %>%
                add_model(elastic_spec)

# regular grids
regular_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(-5, 5)), mixture(range = c(0, 1)), levels = c(penalty = 10, mixture = 10))
```

This will fit 100 models per fold, so since there are 5 folds, we will be fitting 500 models total. 

### Exercise 6

Fit the models to your folded data using `tune_grid()`.

Use `autoplot()` on the results. What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC?

```{r}
# fit models
tune_res <- tune_grid(
  elastic_workflow,
  resamples = pokemon_folds,
  grid = regular_grid
)

# autoplot()
autoplot(tune_res)
```

Looking at the plots, it appears that smaller values of 'penalty' produce better accuracy and roc_auc generally, as the plots decrease sharply as penalty increases. The difference in accuracy and roc_auc based on the value of mixture is harder to tell, as the lines in the plot are all bunched together, so it doesn't appear that having a higher or lower value of mixture will affect accuracy or roc_auc by that much. 

### Exercise 7

Use `select_best()` to choose the model that has the optimal `roc_auc`. Then use `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()`, and `augment()` to fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

```{r}
best_roc <- select_best(tune_res, metric = 'roc_auc')

elastic_final <- finalize_workflow(elastic_workflow, best_roc)
elastic_final_fit <- fit(elastic_final, data = pokemon_train)


classification_metrics <- metric_set(accuracy, mcc, f_meas)
classification_metrics(augment(elastic_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test), truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)
```

It seems like it did not perform too well, with its accuracy of predicting the type standing at only around 0.314. 

### Exercise 8

Calculate the overall ROC AUC on the testing set.

Then create plots of the different ROC curves, one per level of the outcome. Also make a heat map of the confusion matrix.

What do you notice? How did your model do? Which Pokemon types is the model best at predicting, and which is it worst at? Do you have any ideas why this might be?


```{r}
# overall roc auc
roc_auc(augment(elastic_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test), type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Psychic, .pred_Water)

# plot
augment(elastic_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>% 
  roc_curve(type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Psychic, .pred_Water) %>%
  autoplot()

# confusion matrix
augment(elastic_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)  %>% autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

It seems that according to the roc_auc metric, our model did  a decent job, which I found surprising because of its low accuracy. I notice that the results/accuracy differ pretty drastically based on the pokemon type. It appears that the model was best at predicting Normal types by far, and second-best was predicting water types. It was the worst at predicting fire and grass types. Looking through the data, it seems that there are less fire and grass types in general (while there are more normal and water), which may cause the accuracy to suffer as there is less data for the model to "see".
